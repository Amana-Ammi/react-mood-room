                                     THE MOOD ROOM



WHAT AM I?

    The Mood Room was designed to avoid the overwhelming rabbit holes that one may find themselves in while looking for a playlist to listen to. Spotify has so many curated playlists that by the time you find the right one, you might have forgotten what you were truly in the mood for. Then Youtube just throws everything at you, with a little bit of car-detailing videos on the side... or is that just me?

    The Mood Room aims to simplify the search for Vibes. With a limited amount of playlists that are quick and to the point, you can start enjoying that mood you're in to the fullest immediately.
