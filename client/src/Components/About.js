                Long story short, they took over the family business at the age of 21.
                While on a business trip, they were involved in a horrendous explosion that nearly took their life. Ontop of that, they were taken captive by a warlord who wanted the company's product
                for himself. 
                Luckily, they met a fellow Engineer who helped them keep the shrapnel that was lodged near their heart from killing them.
                Putting their minds together, they built the suit of a lifetime and embarked on the ultimate escape. 
                Now, they like to play Metallica whenever they enter a room.

                Kidding! That's Iron Man, silly!

                Although Amonsta does enjoy Metallica, her story isn't quite as dangerous as Tony Starks.
                

                Born an Aquarius in the glorious month of February, music has always been the root of her personality. From charging friends in elementary school
                for printouts of lyrics to making exquisite mixtapes on her Walkman. Amonsta even dabbled in DJing while in college. Filling School Conference After Parties with the vibes of a lifetime
                and even creating the flow for her friend's Legendary Drag Show performances.

                They have become no stranger to the "can you send me new music?" question. It gets overwhelming at times. That's when they decided to create The Mood Room.
                A place unlike your typical streaming app. However, still a place where they can show off new playlists of songs without any barriers to their creativity.

                Here, Amonsta can create visuals to go with the mixes she's creating. A way to truly embed the vibes she's hoping to share with others.

                It is her hope that you vibe as much in The Mood Room as she has. 

                Enjoy!

                Amonsta looks forward to sharing even more with you as The Mood Room grows.

                Love & Light!
